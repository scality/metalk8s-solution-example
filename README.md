# Example Solution for MetalK8s

Basic demo of how to package a Solution for [MetalK8s].

To build the ISO of this Solution, you will need to have installed:

- [`make`][GNU Make], to run the buildchain
- [`docker`][Docker] 17.03 or higher, to build images
- [`skopeo`][Skopeo] 0.1.19 or higher, to save images into the desired format
- [`hardlink`][hardlink], to deduplicate image layers
- [`go`][Go] 1.12 or higher, and [`operator-sdk`][Operator SDK] 0.17 or higher,
  to build the Operator
- `mkisofs` to generate the ISO

Once all of these are installed, just run `make iso`. The generated ISO will be
accessible at `_build/root/example-solution-<version>.iso`.

For iterative development, the `Makefile` provides intermediate targets,
including:

- `make images`, to build, save, and deduplicate image layers
- `make`, or `make all`, to generate the contents of the ISO without building
  the ISO itself (visible under `_build/root`)
- `make operator`, to generate/copy the various Kubernetes manifests used to
  deploy the Operator.

**Note**: if within `$GOPATH/src`, you need to enable Go modules:
`GO111MODULE=on make [<target> ...]`.
